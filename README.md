# SM-Dys-Alarm-Fix
Sourcemod plugins for Dystopia that modifies Cyber Alarm behaviour, mostly intended for comp.

# Default Cyber Alarm behaviour:
1) Decker from a team places Cyber Alarm on ICE
2) Opposing team decker wedges/breaks ICE
3) All opposing team deckers in cyberspace hear the alarm, as well as all deckers on placing team.
- Players without deck on either team do not hear the alarm
- Opposing team deckers who are NOT in cyberspace also do not hear the alarm
 
# Proposed Cyber Alarm behaviour:
1) Same as default
2) Same as default
3) All players on placing team hear the alarm regardless of deck
- Players on opposing team do not hear the alarm (why should they, it's a trap, like a bank silent alarm if you will: https://www.google.com/search?q=define+silent+alarm)
- For comp gameplay's sake, the one or two people who don't have deck will hear the alarm on placing team even if it makes no sense "lore" wise, maybe it's an automatic communication from deckers, who knows.
